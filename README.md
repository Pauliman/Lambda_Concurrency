# Lambda_Concurrency
Here is an attempt to show what the difference is between passing on behavior by means of objects that provide
a certain behavior with their methods and the Lambda way which allows to pass on behavoir directly. 
With Java 1.8 Lambda expressions and @FunctionalInterface(s) have been introduced to make Java more flexible and 
competitive again, but the topic is not exactly straight forward. Maybe this code example makes things a bit easier to the eye.
